    <h1>CS 499 ePortfolio – Jesse Morales</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my capstone portfolio for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program. This page shows my code review, my enhanced artifact, and reflections on what I learned.</p>

    <!-- PROFESSIONAL SELF-ASSESSMENT -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <p>My journey through the Computer Science program has helped me grow in many ways, both as a student and as a future software developer. When I first started the program, I had basic programming knowledge, but I did not fully understand how everything in computer science connects. Through all the courses and projects, I learned how software works from the front end to the back end, how data is stored and managed, and how important good design and clean code really are. Creating my ePortfolio helped me look back at everything I have learned and see how far I have come.</p>

            <p>One of my strengths now is being able to work in a team environment. Many of my classes required group work, communication with classmates, and giving or receiving feedback. These experiences taught me how to discuss ideas clearly, listen to others, and plan work in a professional way. I also learned how to communicate with different kinds of audiences, such as technical teammates and non-technical stakeholders. This skill is important in real jobs because developers often have to explain ideas or problems to people who are not familiar with programming.</p>

            <p>I also gained a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms. I learned how to organize data in efficient ways and how to write logic that solves problems faster and cleaner. These skills help me think through challenges more logically and find better solutions. Improving my algorithm work in the Travlr project showed me how even small changes to logic can make the whole system run better.</p>

            <p>Software engineering and databases became two of my strongest areas. I learned how to design full stack systems, build clean APIs, and use real-world tools like Node, Express, MongoDB, and Angular. I also learned why code structure matters and how to make projects more organized and easier to maintain. In the database part of the program, I learned how to design schemas, validate data, and keep a system secure with proper backend rules. These skills showed up again during my enhancements when I strengthened validation and made the API more reliable.</p>

            <p>Security became another important part of my learning. Many courses taught me how to write safer code, avoid common mistakes, and protect data from attacks. While enhancing my CS465 project, I used a security mindset by making sure only admins could change trips and by improving how errors were handled. This taught me that security does not come from one big change but from many small, careful decisions in the code.</p>

            <p>My enhanced artifact in this portfolio represents the best parts of my learning. The software design enhancement shows how I can make a real project cleaner and more professional. The algorithms enhancement shows how I can improve logic and efficiency. The database enhancement shows how I can work with MongoDB in a secure and organized way. Together, these enhancements show my full range of skills in a single full stack project and demonstrate that I can build and improve real applications.</p>

            <p>Overall, completing this program and creating this ePortfolio has shaped my goals and confidence. I now feel prepared to start a career in software development, full stack development, or backend development. I know how to build useful applications, improve existing code, and solve problems in a professional way. This portfolio represents my growth and shows that I am ready to contribute to a real development team.</p>

    <!-- ENHANCEMENT 1: SOFTWARE DESIGN -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Enhancement One – Software Design and Engineering</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
            <p>The artifact I selected for the software design and engineering enhancement is my CS 465 Travlr full stack project. This project is a travel booking website that includes both a customer-facing site and an admin site. I created it during my full stack development course. The original version included Express routes, Angular components, and a MongoDB connection.</p>

            <h3>Why I Selected This Artifact</h3>
            <p>I chose this artifact because it is one of my strongest full stack projects and it shows real experience working with software design. It has routing, controllers, views, an admin front end, and a database. It is a good example of how all parts of a web app come together. It also gave me a lot of chances to improve the design, remove repeated code, and make the structure more professional.</p>

            <h3>How the Artifact Was Improved</h3>
            <p>For this enhancement, I improved the software design of the project by making the code cleaner, more organized, and easier to maintain. I removed repeated logic from the backend, added helper functions, improved the way async and await were used, and added clearer comments. I also reorganized some files so the structure followed better full stack practices. These changes make the project easier for another developer to read and understand.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>I included this artifact in my portfolio because it shows my ability to build full stack systems and also refactor and improve real code. The updated version demonstrates stronger design decisions and more professional structure. I learned that small design changes can make a big difference in how easy a project is to work with. This enhancement helped me meet the software engineering outcome and grow my skills in organizing code.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- ENHANCEMENT 2: ALGORITHMS -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Enhancement Two – Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
            <p>For the algorithms and data structures enhancement, I continued working on the CS 465 Travlr full stack project. This time, I focused on improving how the app handles data, searches for trips, and organizes information.</p>

            <h3>Why I Selected This Artifact</h3>
            <p>I selected this artifact again because it gave me room to improve the logic and structure of the code. The project already worked, but the original version used simple patterns for filtering and sorting. That allowed me to show that I understand how to take working code and make the logic cleaner and more efficient.</p>

            <h3>How the Artifact Was Improved</h3>
            <p>In the original version, some queries and filtering were handled on the front end or written in basic ways that were not always efficient. For the enhancement, I improved the logic by adding better sorting and filtering of trips and made sure the logic was in one place instead of being repeated. I also replaced repeated loops with single reusable functions and added more structured logic for handling dates, prices, and filtering rules. These changes made the backend easier to understand and more efficient.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>This enhancement allowed me to show my skills with algorithms in a real project. I learned how reorganizing logic can make a big difference in how easy it is to maintain and extend a system. It also showed me how important it is to avoid repeated logic. I met the algorithms outcome by improving how the app processes trip data and by making the logic more consistent and efficient.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- ENHANCEMENT 3: DATABASES -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Enhancement Three – Databases</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
            <p>The artifact I selected for the database enhancement is also my CS 465 Travlr full stack project. This project uses MongoDB and Mongoose to store trip information. In the original version, the database worked but needed stronger validation, clearer models, and better error handling.</p>

            <h3>Why I Selected This Artifact</h3>
            <p>I chose this artifact for the database category because it uses a real NoSQL database and models. It let me show skills with MongoDB, Mongoose, and backend design. The original project was a solid base, but I saw that the schema, error handling, and admin security could all be improved.</p>

            <h3>How the Artifact Was Improved</h3>
            <p>For the enhancement, I updated the trip schema with more detailed rules, such as required fields, proper data types, and limits to prevent bad data from being saved. I then cleaned up the queries in the controllers so the database code used a clear and consistent pattern. I added try and catch blocks for database actions to prevent the server from crashing. I also updated the admin routes so only logged-in admins can change data, which improved security for the database.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>This artifact shows my skills with MongoDB, Mongoose, and validation. Improving the schema and database logic helped me understand how important clean database design is for real apps. One challenge was making sure the front end still worked after adding stronger rules, so I had to test carefully. This enhancement helped me meet the database outcome and also improved my security mindset by making the backend safer and more stable.</p>
